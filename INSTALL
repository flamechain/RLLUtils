For Windows Binaries:

    Start by opening powershell in administrator mode. Make sure to navigate to the folder where you extracted this archive.
    For example, if you used File Explorer copy the path and run 'cd "%"' replacing % with the path.

    Then run 'choco'. If it returns with 'choco: the term 'choco' is not recognized ...' run './install.ps1'.
    Now restart powershell (making sure to still be in administrator mode) and run 'choco install make' and type 'Y' when prompted.

    Then restart powershell again and run 'make INSTALL_DIR="%"' replacing % with where you want to install RLLUtils.

    To uninstall run 'make INSTALL_DIR="%" uninstall' replacing % with where you installed RLLUtils.

To Build Sources (Requires GnuWin32):

    Start powershell in administrator and run 'make install INSTALL_DIR="%"' replacing % with where you want to install RLLUtils.

    To uninstall run 'make uninstall INSTALL_DIR="%"' replacing % with where you installed RLLUtils.
