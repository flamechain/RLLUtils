For Windows Binaries:

    Note that this will not work without administrator mode.

    Start by opening powershell in administrator mode. Make sure to navigate to the folder where you extracted this archive.
    For example, if you used File Explorer copy the path and run 'cd "%"' replacing % with the path.
    You will have to repeat this step every time you restart powershell.
    Also make sure to run in administrator mode every time you restart powershell.

    Run 'choco'. If it returns with 'choco: the term 'choco' is not recognized ...' run 'Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass; ./install.ps1' (type 'Y' if prompted).
    Now restart powershell and run 'choco install make' (type 'Y' if prompted).

    Then restart powershell again and run 'make INSTALL_DIR="%"' replacing % with where you want to install RLLUtils.
        example: make INSTALL_DIR="C:\Program Files\RLLUtils"

    To uninstall run 'make INSTALL_DIR="%" uninstall' replacing % with where you installed RLLUtils. You may be prompted, type 'Y' if so.
        example: make INSTALL_DIR="C:\Program Files\RLLUtils" uninstall

To Build Sources (Requires GnuWin32):

    Start powershell in administrator and run 'make install INSTALL_DIR="%"' replacing % with where you want to install RLLUtils.

    To uninstall run 'make uninstall INSTALL_DIR="%"' replacing % with where you installed RLLUtils.
